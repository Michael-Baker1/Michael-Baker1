`Aspiring IT Professional | Building Labs & Projects`

I’m working toward launching my career in IT. I recently completed my **Associate’s Degree in IT** and the **CourseCareers IT course**, and I’m currently focused on documenting labs and hands-on projects that show my technical growth.  

I believe in learning by doing, so everything you see here will come from real practice, problem-solving, and experimentation.
